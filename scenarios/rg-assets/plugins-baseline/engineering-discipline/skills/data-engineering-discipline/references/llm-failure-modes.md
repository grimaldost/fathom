# LLM Failure Modes in Data Engineering

This skill is consumed by an LLM workflow. LLMs introduce specific failure
modes that mechanical discipline must defend against, because the agent
will not self-correct without scaffolding.

The dominant pattern is **plausible-but-wrong code**: output that compiles,
runs, and produces believable numbers while silently changing meaning. SQL
is especially dangerous because failures don't throw — they return numbers
that look fine. The defense is always mechanical: contracts, parity diffs,
CI gates, hooks — never social ("the agent should know better").

For each failure mode below, four parts:

1. **Mode** — what goes wrong.
2. **Detection** — how to spot it happening (signals to watch for).
3. **Defense** — the mechanical countermeasure.
4. **Concrete example** — drawn from real cases.

---

## Mode 1 — Plausible-but-wrong code

**The pattern.** The agent generates SQL or Python that compiles, runs,
and produces output that looks reasonable to a quick glance. Under
specific data conditions, it silently drops rows, coarsens groups,
mismatches dtypes, or applies a transformation that's subtly wrong.

**Detection signals.**

- Row count of new output is suspiciously close to but not exactly equal
  to the baseline row count.
- Aggregates differ by small percentages that get hand-waved as "rounding."
- Edge-case partitions (month-end, year-end, leap days) show larger
  deviations than typical partitions.
- The agent says "the data looks right" without having run a diff.
- New code "works on the sample" but the sample is hand-crafted.

**Defense.**

- Row-level + aggregate parity diff against the baseline output as a
  non-negotiable done-gate. The baseline is the legacy output for a
  migration, the current output for a refactor, the declared contract
  for a new dataset, the last-known-good output for an investigation.
  See `parity-recipes.md`.
- Schema diff (columns + dtypes) before any data comparison.
- "Looks reasonable" is forbidden as a done-criterion. Looks reasonable
  is the *weakest* test pyramid layer; it cannot replace contract checks
  or parity diffs.

**Example (migration form).** Migration silently changes the output of
a daily aggregate. Row count: existing 69,449, new 31,032. Aggregates:
existing total amount $4.2M, new total $4.2M. The agent reports "totals
match, looks good." The row count delta means each row in the new output
represents a coarser grouping than before. The total matches because
aggregation is associative; the per-row meaning has silently changed.

**Example (new-dataset form).** The first run of a new pipeline
produces 50,000 rows. The agent says "that's a reasonable volume for a
customer dimension." A row-count check against the source (which has
55,000 distinct customers) would reveal 5,000 customers silently
dropped by a join condition.

---

## Mode 2 — Plan drift / context truncation

**The pattern.** In multi-turn sessions, the agent writes a plan early
based on a quick read of the existing code (or upstream data, or
upstream spec). The plan becomes the source of truth as the
conversation progresses. Code is built against the plan rather than
against the primary source. When the plan was lossy — and it always is
— the build inherits the loss.

This is the dominant LLM failure mode across all scenarios. In
migrations and refactors, the plan misses corner-case branches in
existing code. In new-dataset work, the plan misses corner-case values
in source data. In schema-evolution work, the plan misses the current
materialized schema (vs. the schema YAML).

**Detection signals.**

- The agent references the "plan" or "task list" when justifying a code
  decision, rather than the primary source (code, data, or spec).
- The agent says "as we discussed earlier" about details that were
  inferred, not verified.
- The agent has not re-opened the primary source file in the last
  several turns.
- The session is long; context is summarized; specific column names or
  identifiers are paraphrased rather than quoted.
- "Integrate X later" appears in the plan and X never returns.

**Defense.**

- **Re-read the primary source at the start of each phase**, regardless
  of confidence. The plan is a notepad; the source is the contract.
- For multi-day work, re-establish context at the start of each session
  by reading source files, not by reading conversation summaries.
- The plan tracks intent; the primary source tracks reality. When they
  disagree, reality wins.

**Example (migration form).** A real migration had a plan that captured
"orders + revenue data" as one input. The actual source script extracted
TWO tables. The agent deferred the second indefinitely; the `revenue`
column silently disappeared from output. A migration like this can take
dozens of commits to chase the gap back down.

**Example (new-dataset form).** The plan describes a source as
"customer events." The actual source has three distinct event types
with different shapes. The new pipeline handles only the first type
and silently drops the others.

---

## Mode 3 — "Improving while executing a scope-bounded task"

**The pattern.** The agent reflexively renames columns for clarity,
simplifies schemas, refactors architecture, splits modules — during
any task whose scope was supposed to be bounded. Each individual change
is a legitimate engineering choice in isolation. Bundled into a
scope-limited task, they are silent regressions.

This is the universal form of "improving while migrating." It applies
to migrations (where the scope is bug-for-bug parity), refactors (where
the scope is no functional change), schema-evolution PRs (where the
scope is one specific change), and bug-fix PRs (where the scope is the
bug, not adjacent cleanup).

**Detection signals.**

- The agent describes a code change as "cleaner," "more consistent," or
  "more pythonic" during a scope-bounded task.
- Column names in the new output don't match the existing output
  exactly (in a migration or refactor).
- Group keys in the new aggregate are a subset of the existing keys.
- A "redundant" column or group key is dropped without a divergence
  document.
- The agent says "I noticed this was suboptimal and fixed it" without
  having asked first.
- The PR's diff is larger than the stated scope implies.

**Defense.**

- Explicit **improvement-freeze rule** in the scope-bounded task's
  agent instructions: improvements are deferred to a backlog file
  (`IMPROVEMENTS.md`) consulted after the scoped task completes.
- Every code change in a scope-bounded PR must map to either:
  (a) a baseline-preserving translation,
  (b) a documented divergence in the appropriate artifact
      (`MIGRATION_NOTES.md`, `CONTRACT_CHANGELOG.md`) with sign-off,
  (c) an item on the post-task improvements backlog.
- Parity gate enforces no column renames during migrations / refactors.
- For new-dataset and schema-evolution scenarios, the analogous gate is
  contract conformance: the producer's output matches the declared
  contract exactly.

**Example (migration form).** A migration silently renames `unit_cost
→ uc`, `base_fee → base_fee_amt`, `margin_raw → margin`. Each
rename looks reasonable — shorter, more consistent. Downstream Excel
workbooks keyed on the original names break the next morning.

**Example (refactor form).** A "pure refactor" PR also tightens a
constraint from `nullable: true` to `nullable: false` because "the data
doesn't seem to have nulls." The next month-end batch hits the null
case and the pipeline fails.

**Example (new-dataset form).** The declared contract says `tier` is
one of `bronze`, `silver`, `gold`, `platinum`. The producer writes
`diamond` too because "the source has that value." The contract drifted
from the implementation; downstream consumers crash on the new value.

---

## Mode 4 — Synthetic-fixtures-only validation

**The pattern.** The LLM writes both the production code and the test
fixtures. The fixtures satisfy the code's assumptions because the same
mind generated both. The unit tests pass at high coverage. Real
production data fails immediately because production data violates
assumptions the LLM didn't think to encode in fixtures.

**Detection signals.**

- Test coverage is very high (>90%) and tests were written by the LLM.
- Fixtures are small (single-digit row counts) and hand-crafted.
- Tests pass deterministically every time.
- The agent has not run the code against production-shaped data.
- All edge cases tested are "obvious" edge cases (null, empty); none
  reflect actual production distributions.

**Defense.**

- Pair every LLM-generated unit test suite with a real-data integration
  test that uses fixtures **the LLM did not generate** — sampled directly
  from production.
- Required staging run on at least the last 30 days of production data
  before declaring done.
- Every constraint declared in the schema must be validated against
  production data (see Principle 10).

**Example.** Schema declares `nullable: false` on `rate_frag`, `uc`,
`margin`, `base_fee_amt`. Every unit test passes (fixtures had no
nulls). First staging run fails: adjustment coverage gaps produce null
`uc`; same-day operations have `tenure_days=0` → division by zero →
null. The constraints were drafted from "what makes sense," not from
"what production data actually looks like."

---

## Mode 5 — Confabulated signatures and identifiers

**The pattern.** The agent generates plausible function calls with
wrong parameter names, wrong return types, or non-existent string
identifiers. The patterns come from training-data priors, not from the
current installed version of the library.

**Detection signals.**

- The agent calls a function it hasn't called recently in the session.
- The agent uses a string identifier (calendar name, source name, schema
  name) without first listing the registry.
- The agent uses keyword arguments with names that "sound right" but
  weren't verified.
- Runtime errors of the form `TypeError: unexpected keyword argument
  'rtol'` or `KeyError: 'calendar_c'`.

**Defense.**

- For any unfamiliar primitive, **a 10-line smoke script using
  `inspect.signature(fn)` is a required first step**:

```python
import inspect
from mylib.compute import weighted_average
print(inspect.signature(weighted_average))
# Now you know the actual parameter names.
```

- For any string identifier, enumerate the registry first:

```python
from mylib.calendars import list_calendars
print(list_calendars())
# ['calendar_a', 'calendar_b', ...]
```

- Treat every keyword argument as suspect until verified.

**Example.** A single migration phase produced eight signature
confabulations caught at runtime:

| Confabulated | Actual |
|--------------|--------|
| `assert_frame_equal(rtol=...)` | `rel_tol=` |
| `weighted_average(keys=...)` | `group_cols=` |
| `business_date_range(...)` returns `Date` | Returns `Datetime[μs]` |
| `WindowSpec(as_of_date=Series)` | Takes `Sequence[date]` |
| `apply_adjustment(...)` for resample | Use `resample_bulk` |
| `resample_bulk(value_col=...)` | `@singledispatch`, positional only |
| Output col == input col name | Output col literally `'interpolated'` |
| Calendar `'calendar_c'` | Registry has `'calendar_a'` |

Each cost a debug round. Total cost: hours. Cost of `inspect.signature`
per primitive: 30 seconds.

---

## Mode 6 — "Looks reasonable" as the done-gate

**The pattern.** The agent runs the pipeline, eyeballs the output, sees
plausible numbers, declares done. Skips the test pyramid layers entirely.

**Detection signals.**

- Done-claim arrives before the parity diff has run.
- Done-claim references "the data looks correct" or "the totals match"
  without specific numerical comparisons.
- No mention of contract checks, unit tests, or parity gates.
- The agent has run the pipeline exactly once.

**Defense.**

- The pre-shipping checklist in `SKILL.md` is the active gate. If any
  item cannot be answered "yes," the work is not done.
- "Looks reasonable" is the production-observability layer of the test
  pyramid — the *weakest* gate. It cannot substitute for contract or
  parity gates.
- For migrations and refactors: row-level diff against the baseline is
  the done-gate, not eyeballing. For new datasets: contract conformance
  + real-data integration test. For schema evolutions: compatibility
  check + consumer notification.

**Example (migration form).** In the session that motivated this
skill, three earlier moments declared "done" before parity tests
revealed schema divergences. Each "done" claim was based on "the
pipeline runs and the data looks reasonable." Each time, a parity diff
was deferred. Each time, the parity diff — when finally run — found a
regression.

**Example (new-dataset form).** The agent ships a new pipeline,
declares done because "the rows look right." A later constraint check
against 90 days of production data reveals 200 violations of a declared
`not_null` constraint. The eyeball test missed what the constraint
check would have caught immediately.

---

## Mode 7 — Confidence miscalibration / no escalation under uncertainty

**The pattern.** The agent has no instinct to escalate when uncertain.
It confabulates with the same fluent confidence as when correct. A
junior engineer would say "I'm not sure — can you clarify?" An LLM
ships.

**Detection signals.**

- The agent makes a decision based on ambiguous spec text without
  flagging the ambiguity.
- The agent picks a default when multiple interpretations are reasonable,
  without surfacing the choice.
- The agent's code review responses say "I made this choice because…"
  retroactively, rather than "I'd like to ask…" proactively.

**Defense.**

- Encode the ambiguity-flagging requirement in agent instructions: when
  spec text is ambiguous, stop and ask before proceeding.
- Code review checklist: every defaulted choice the agent made is
  re-validated by a human before merge.
- For high-risk areas (contracts, schema changes, migrations), require
  explicit sign-off on every interpretation.

**Example (migration form).** "Match the legacy output" leaves dozens
of small choices — exact dtype representation, exact ordering of group
keys, exact null behavior on edge cases. An LLM resolves each silently.
A human-in-the-loop reviewer would catch divergences before they ship;
an LLM left alone produces a migration that compiles but doesn't match.

**Example (new-dataset form).** A contract spec says `tier` is one of
"bronze, silver, gold, platinum." The source data also has `enterprise`
and `trial` values. The LLM either silently buckets them into the
declared enum (wrong) or fails on every row (better, but disruptive).
The right move is to flag the discrepancy before writing the
transform.

---

## Mode 8 — Plan-as-spec drift across sessions

**The pattern.** Across multiple sessions (or after context
truncation), the agent loses track of the *original* contract (legacy
contract for a migration, source-data shape for a new dataset, current
contract for a schema evolution) and works from session-summary
surrogates. Subsequent sessions inherit distortions from earlier ones.

**Detection signals.**

- Multi-session work where the second-session agent never re-reads the
  primary source files (existing code, source data, contract YAML).
- Session-handoff summaries that paraphrase rather than quote.
- Column names mentioned in handoff don't exactly match column names in
  the primary source.
- Disagreement between sessions on what the contract "is."

**Defense.**

- Session handoff includes primary-source file references, not just
  summaries. Subsequent sessions re-read the files.
- Persist the baseline (schema, row count, aggregates, declared
  contract) as a versioned artifact in the repo. Subsequent sessions
  diff against the artifact, not against memory.
- Treat `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` / `CONTRACT_CHANGELOG.md` as the
  authoritative log of intentional changes. Anything not in it is an
  unintentional divergence to investigate.

**Example (migration form).** A two-week migration spans many
sessions. By session five, the agent is convinced that `payment_method`
was always excluded from the group-by because session three "decided"
that. Session three actually deferred the decision, with a TODO.
Session one's plan listed `payment_method` as a required group key.
Reading the legacy code (which no session did after session one) would
have ended the confusion in thirty seconds.

**Example (schema-evolution form).** A long-running schema-evolution
project spans many sessions. The contract YAML was updated in session
two to add a `customer_tier_v2` column. Session five sees only the
session-summary mention of "tier work" and produces code that writes
to the deprecated `customer_tier` column. Reading the current
contract YAML would have caught the staleness immediately.

---

## Mode 9 — Fabricated telemetry: async status events treated as system state

**The pattern.** In orchestrated or long-running work, the agent treats
asynchronous status signals — progress notifications, monitor streams,
dry-run callbacks, "approved" / "merged" / "complete" events, cost
summaries — as the system's actual state. They are the agent's (or a
tool's) *narration about* the system, generated from expectation, not
read from it. When the narration runs ahead of reality, the agent acts
on events that never happened: it reports approvals for work not done,
marks runs complete that did not finish, records costs for runs that did
not execute.

This is Axiom 2's blind spot in its sharpest form. Modes 2 and 8 cover
*drift* — a fact that existed, paraphrased lossily. This is *invention* —
a fact that never existed, asserted with the same fluent confidence.

**Detection signals.**

- A status claim ("wave approved", "all merged", "5/5 passed") with no
  artifact named — no commit SHA, no log line, no file on disk.
- An outcome reported before the process that produces it could have
  finished; costs and identifiers that are too clean, too fast, or
  suspiciously round.
- Bulk success in progress/dry-run output ("COMPLETE … SUCCESS" for every
  item at once) rather than one verified result at a time.
- The agent narrates the next step's result while still inside the
  current step.

**Defense — the disk-truth protocol.**

- Every event claim is unconfirmed until verified against an append-only
  source: VCS state (the commit/merge on disk), an append-only run log,
  the process table, the materialized artifact. A notification is a prompt
  to go look, not a fact.
- No state-changing action and no status report on the strength of an
  event alone — read the disk truth first.
- For an orchestrated run, the close step is an independent
  re-verification from disk (git log, tracker file, process exit), never
  a trust of the run's own progress stream.

**Example.** An orchestration run reported two waves of approvals — with
realistic costs and plausible branch names — for changes that had not
been created; a `git log` would have shown nothing. Separately, a dry-run
emitted "COMPLETE … SUCCESS" for every item in a series it had not
executed. In both, the defense is identical: the commit on disk is the
truth; the event is a claim.

---

## Mode 10 — Confabulated anchors and projected verification

**The pattern.** The agent cites an anchor — a test, a fixture, a file
path, a line range, a symbol — that it never actually read or that does
not exist, and builds on it as if verified. Three shapes recur:

- *Fabricated anchor* — the cited test / fixture / file isn't in the tree.
- *Projected verification* — one part is checked and the whole is recorded
  clean.
- *Partial read* — a `file:lo-hi` slice that ends inside an open
  collection literal, read as complete, producing *higher* false
  confidence than no read at all.

This is Mode 5 generalized from library calls to *any* cited referent,
and it is the verification-side twin of Mode 9: there the agent invents
the system's state; here it invents the evidence that the state was
checked.

**Detection signals.**

- A "verified" / "confirmed clean" claim that doesn't name the exact scope
  checked ("verified the file" rather than "verified the constants table
  only").
- A cited `file:line` range whose end falls inside an unclosed `[`, `{`,
  or `(` — the read was sliced mid-literal.
- A spec or review names a fixture / test / symbol that a grep doesn't
  find.
- A handed-down brief ("X drifted; add Y") applied without reading the
  cited X — and the brief turns out accurate-but-incomplete.

**Defense — the anchor-provenance pass.**

- Every cited anchor traces to a read actually performed. Before shipping
  a spec or a review, grep-verify each cited `file:line` / fixture /
  symbol exists and says what you claim.
- A verified-clean entry names the exact scope read. "Verified clean"
  without a scope is an unverified claim wearing a verified label.
- A cited line range that ends inside an unclosed bracket / brace is
  evidence the read was truncated — re-read to the closing delimiter
  before citing any collection literal.
- A handed-down fix brief is a *claim*, not a contract: when a task
  supplies a root cause AND a fix, verify each cited anchor against the
  source before applying. The brief's own diagnostic step is often the
  tell that a second site needs the same change.

**Example.** A spec cited a parity-baseline fixture that did not exist in
the tree (fabricated anchor). A reviewer verified one table in a config
file and recorded the whole file clean; six other entries had wrong
signatures (projected verification). A `file:0-40` read ended inside a
list literal, so a three-element set was read as two and the truncated
value became the spec's concrete instance (partial read). A handed-down
brief said "the hook drifted; add the missing entry to its exclusion
set"; reading the source showed the *scanner's* exclusion set was
byte-identical and *also* lacked the entry — the one-file fix was a
two-file fix, and the brief's own step-1 diagnostic ("read the scanner;
is it missing too?") was the tell.

---

## Mode 11 — The verifier inherits none of the design's documented traps

**The pattern.** A design or spec documents a pattern trap (a regex that
matches only column-0 anchors and misses function-scoped imports; an enum
that must include a rare value). Then a *fresh* piece of verification or
pattern-matching code — a review script, a CI check, the run's own first
verifier — reproduces the exact trap the design warned about, because the
trap lived only in the design doc and the verifier's author (a different
agent, or the same agent in a different role) never read it.

**Detection signals.**

- A verifier / check / review script written from scratch in a wave whose
  design documents a relevant trap.
- Pattern-matching anchored on position (column 0, line start) rather than
  content.
- The trap is recorded in a design doc or ADR that the verifier's prompt
  does not include.
- "We documented this" used as if documentation were enforcement.

**Defense.**

- Put traps in the artifacts the verifier actually reads — the review
  prompt, a wave-output flag, the checker's own test fixtures — not only
  in the design doc.
- A documented trap is a candidate test case: encode it as a
  planted-failure fixture the verifier must catch, so a verifier blind to
  the trap fails its own self-test.
- Treat "the design documents X" as necessary, not sufficient: the
  question is whether the code that checks for X reads where X is written.

**Example.** A wave's design documented that a column-0-anchored regex
would miss function-scoped imports. The run's own first verification
script — written fresh for that wave — used a column-0-anchored regex and
missed exactly those imports. The trap was in the design doc; the verifier
read only its prompt.

---

## Mode 12 — Silence read as status on an unattended run

**The pattern.** On a long unattended job — an overnight migration, a
headless multi-PR run, a backfill left to churn — the agent treats the
*absence* of new output as a fact: a tracker that hasn't moved and a HEAD
that hasn't advanced get read as "it finished" or "it stopped," and the
agent reports done or steps in to take over. But a quiet job is
slow-versus-dead-ambiguous: a still-live writer mid-computation and a
wedged process produce the *same* surface (no new lines, unmoved HEAD).
Acting on the inference corrupts the work — declaring a still-running job
complete reports a result that isn't materialized yet; taking over a
still-live writer collides two processes on the same worktree.

This is the inverse of Mode 9. Mode 9 is a *fabricated* event — narration
ahead of reality. This is a *missing* event read as a terminal state —
silence treated as a status it cannot, on its own, convey. Both share the
Axiom-2 root: a signal *about* the system stood in for the system.

**Detection signals.**

- A "the run finished / stalled / is stuck" claim with no independent
  observable named — no process-table check, no artifact mtime, no log
  tail, only "nothing new appeared."
- A takeover (kill, branch reset, re-fire) about to start on the strength
  of a frozen tracker alone.
- "No errors, so it must have worked" on a job whose result was never read
  from disk.
- The job's own progress stream is trusted to *stop reporting* as proof of
  termination (a wedged process stops reporting too).

**Defense — disambiguate before acting, verify from disk before reporting.**

- Silence is a prompt to probe, not a status. Disambiguate slow-vs-dead
  with an independent observable: the process tree (is the writer still
  alive?), artifact mtimes (is anything still being written?), an
  append-only run log's tail. Only a dead process *and* quiescent artifacts
  is "stopped."
- A watcher that reports the world gone may be reporting its own instrument
  broken: a git-bash `/c/...` path handed to a Windows interpreter reads as a
  different, empty location, so a live workspace looks absent. Probe the observer
  with a known-present path first — if it cannot see a thing that certainly
  exists, the "gone" verdict is the observer failing, not the target.
- No state-changing takeover — kill, branch reset, re-fire — until
  quiescence is confirmed; a takeover that collides with a live writer
  corrupts the worktree, and that is the irreversible move.
- Completion is read from the materialized result (Mode 9's disk-truth
  protocol), never inferred from quiet. "No new errors" is not "succeeded";
  a job can die silently between log lines.
- When the gates-green output of a stalled run is salvageable, the recovery
  sequence is itself disciplined: confirm quiescence, review the in-diff
  artifact, re-verify it independently from disk, then merge — the same
  observable-source discipline the run itself owed.

**Example.** An overnight multi-PR run went quiet: the tracker file hadn't
advanced in an hour and HEAD was unmoved. Read as "stuck," the safe-looking
move was to take over and re-fire. The independent probe told a different
story each time it was run — a process-tree check plus artifact mtimes
distinguished a writer still mid-PR (do not touch) from a genuinely wedged
orchestrator (safe to salvage). Where the run had genuinely stopped with a
gates-green PR in the tree, the recovery was a quiescence check → in-diff
review → independent re-verify → merge, not a blind re-run.

---

## Mode 13 — Fail-open tooling: a check that passes when it errors

**The pattern.** A gate is written so that *failing to run* and *finding
nothing* produce the same green verdict. The classic shape is
`command | filter` with "no output means pass": if the command itself is
absent from PATH, mis-invoked, or errors out, it prints nothing, the filter
matches nothing, and the gate reports clean — not because the tree is clean
but because the check never executed. A return-code-blind gate (pattern-
matching stdout while ignoring a non-zero exit) and an exception-swallowing
validator (`try: check() except: pass`) have the same defect. A gate that
manufactures false confidence is worse than no gate: no gate at least leaves
you knowing you haven't checked.

This is Mode 12's logic inside the project's own tooling — *absence of
output* read as *found-nothing*, when it may mean *the check didn't run*.
The per-invocation environment is not always sticky across an agent's
shell calls, so a tool present in one step can be missing in the next, and
a fence built on it silently flips from enforcing to vacuous.

**Detection signals.**

- A gate of the form `<tool> ... | grep/Select-String ...` whose pass
  condition is "no matching lines," with no prior check that `<tool>` exists
  and exited zero.
- A check that prints `CLEAN` / `PASS` unconditionally on an empty result,
  including the empty result an error produces.
- Stdout parsed for a success token while the process's exit code is
  discarded.
- A `try/except` around a validation step whose `except` branch lets the
  caller proceed.
- A gate that has never been observed to fail — neither on a planted bad
  input nor when its own tool was removed.

**Defense — distinguish did-not-run from found-nothing.**

- A check is fail-closed only when *tool-missing* is distinguishable from
  *nothing-found*. Assert the command exists and exited zero before trusting
  an empty result; treat a non-zero exit as BLOCKED, not CLEAN.
- Prefer a built-in over a shelled-out external tool for a fence (a
  language built-in or `Select-String` / Python over a PATH-dependent
  binary), so tool-absence can't silently zero the result.
- Let exceptions in a validator propagate, or catch-and-fail — never
  catch-and-pass. The error path defaults to blocked.
- Prove the gate can fail twice: once on a planted violation (Scenario 8's
  plant-fires), and once by removing its own tool — a fail-closed gate goes
  red in both cases.

**Example.** A documentation fence ran `<formatter> --check ... | <filter>`
and treated empty output as pass. In a shell where the formatter binary
wasn't on PATH that invocation, the command errored, printed nothing, and
the fence reported CLEAN over a tree it had never inspected. Rewritten to
assert the tool resolved and exited zero — and to read a non-zero exit as
BLOCKED — the same fence went correctly red the next time the tool was
absent, surfacing the gap instead of hiding it.

---

## Mode 14 — Traced the wrong copy: editable-vs-installed / stale-cache divergence

**The pattern.** The agent debugs a behavior by reading source — but the
source it reads is not the code the process runs. The same library is present
twice: an editable checkout (`pip install -e`, a sibling repo on `PYTHONPATH`)
and an installed release in the venv, often at different versions with
different internals. The agent traces the editable copy, forms a confident
causal claim from it, and the claim is false because the *release* copy — a
different architecture — is what executed.

This is Axiom 2's blind spot at import resolution: reading source is only
observation if it is the source that ran. Mode 10 cites an anchor that doesn't
exist; this reads a real anchor that isn't the live one.

**Detection signals.**

- A behavior / regression claim ("the source has no 2026-06-16 branch", "this
  function returns X") with no `module.__file__` / version resolved first.
- The library is present editable AND as a release (a sibling checkout plus a
  venv install), or a stale `__pycache__` / cached wheel is in play.
- Logger names, class names, or code paths in the real run don't match the
  source being read (`facade._sink` runs while `manager._parquet` is read).
- "I verified by reading the code" — but the failing path was never run.

**Defense — resolve the loaded module before reading its source.**

- Before any source-based behavior claim, run
  `python -c "import m; print(m.__file__, getattr(m, '__version__', '?'))"`
  and read *that* file. The run's logs / emitted query / loaded-module path
  outrank the source tree.
- In editable / multi-repo / stale-cache setups, treat "I read the code" as
  unverified until the loaded path is confirmed.
- This is the data form of `systematic-debugging`'s "confirm the source you
  read is the code that runs."

**Example.** A "DI pipeline ran but the dataset didn't update to 2026-06-16"
regression: the agent traced an editable `treasuryutils 0.6.x` sibling and
asserted "the source has no 2026-06-16" — while the venv imported the `1.0.1`
release, a different read architecture. A direct query showed the date existed
(3,644 rows). One `import treasuryutils; print(__file__, version)` before
reading would have pre-empted pages of wrong inference.

## Cross-mode patterns

Several failure modes share common roots:

**"The agent prefers reasoning over data inspection."**
Modes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 all reflect this. The defense pattern is identical
across them: require concrete data inspection at specific gates. The
parity diff is the data-inspection gate that covers all five modes.

**"The agent treats summarized context as ground truth."**
Modes 2, 5, 8 share this. The defense pattern: re-read primary sources
(existing code, library signatures, contract YAML, source data) rather
than trusting session summaries — and (Mode 14) confirm the primary source
you re-read is the copy that actually runs, not an editable or cached twin.

**"The agent improves what it shouldn't and accepts what it shouldn't."**
Modes 3, 7 share this. The defense pattern: explicit instructions about
when to defer to the user vs. when to act.

**"The agent fabricates evidence and presents it as observation."**
Modes 9, 10, 11 share this — the sharpest form of the Axiom-2 violation:
not drift from a fact that existed, but a fact, anchor, or verification
*invented*. The defense is identical across them: disk truth over
narration — every event, every cited anchor, every "verified" claim
traces to something actually read from an append-only source (VCS state,
logs, the materialized artifact, the file at the cited line). Where Modes
2/5/8 say "re-read the source instead of the summary," these say "confirm
the thing exists at all before citing it."

**"The agent reads absence as a state."**
Modes 12, 13 share this — the mirror image of the fabrication family.
There a signal was invented; here a *missing* signal is over-read: silence
on an unattended run taken as "finished/stopped" (12), or an empty
check-result taken as "clean" when the check may not have run (13). The
defense is the same shape in both: an absence is a prompt to probe, not a
verdict — confirm the process is actually dead (not just quiet) and the
tool actually ran (not just silent) before acting on "nothing happened."
The Axiom-2 root is shared with 9/10/11 (a signal about the system stood
in for the system); the tell is opposite — too little output read as a
conclusion rather than too much asserted as a fact.

## Mechanical defenses summary

Every mode above is defended by one or more of these mechanical layers:

| Defense | Modes addressed | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Row-level + aggregate parity diff | 1, 3, 4, 6 | See `parity-recipes.md` |
| Schema diff in CI | 1, 3 | dbt `state:modified`, custom scripts |
| Contract enforcement | 1, 3, 4 | dbt contracts, ODCS YAML |
| Re-read primary sources each phase | 2, 5, 8 | Agent-instructions rule |
| `inspect.signature` smoke script | 5 | Required before unfamiliar primitive |
| Registry enumeration before identifier use | 5 | Required before string identifier use |
| Production-data constraint validation | 4 | Pre-flight queries in `principles.md` Principle 10 |
| Real-data integration tests | 4 | Required staging run before "done" |
| Improvement-freeze rule | 3 | Explicit in agent instructions |
| Documented divergences (MIGRATION_NOTES) | 3, 7, 8 | Required artifact |
| Ambiguity-flagging requirement | 7 | Agent instructions: ask before defaulting |
| Disk-truth protocol (events vs VCS/logs/disk) | 9, 12 | Append-only source check before any status report or state-changing action |
| Anchor-provenance pass (cited anchors trace to a read) | 5, 10 | Name the scope verified; read to the closing delimiter; grep-verify the cited `file:line`/fixture/symbol exists |
| Resolve the loaded module before a source claim | 14 | `python -c "import m; print(m.__file__, m.__version__)"`; logs / loaded path outrank the source tree |
| Traps in the verifier's own inputs | 11 | Review prompts, planted-failure fixtures, wave-output flags |
| Liveness probe before takeover (process tree + artifact mtimes) | 12 | Confirm dead *and* quiescent before any kill / reset / re-fire; completion read from the materialized result |
| Fail-closed-tooling check (did-not-run ≠ found-nothing) | 13 | Assert the tool exists and exited zero; non-zero exit is BLOCKED; prefer built-ins for fences; catch-and-fail, never catch-and-pass |
| Pre-shipping checklist | 6, all | `SKILL.md` |

None of these defenses rely on the agent's self-assessment. All are
mechanical: code, files, CI gates, runnable scripts. **Make the
discipline mechanical, not social.**

## The "LLM as junior engineer" framing — and where it breaks

The transferable discipline patterns from teaching juniors:

- Code review.
- Conventions docs (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md).
- Pre-commit hooks.
- CI gates.
- Pair programming.

Where the analogy breaks down:

- A junior engineer has **shame** about silent breakage. An LLM has none.
- A junior engineer **escalates** when uncertain. An LLM confabulates
  with the same fluent confidence.
- A junior engineer **remembers** yesterday's conversation. An LLM's
  context window forgets.
- A junior engineer can **detect their own confusion**. An LLM cannot
  distinguish certainty from confidence.

The corrective: every place where a junior engineer's instinct would
catch a problem, the LLM workflow needs a mechanical replacement. Schema
diff catches what the junior's eye would catch. Parity diff catches what
the junior's "wait, that doesn't look right" would catch. CI gates catch
what the junior would escalate. Hooks catch what the junior would
double-check.

This is what "make the discipline mechanical, not social" means in
practice. The discipline exists because the agent cannot supply it
itself.
